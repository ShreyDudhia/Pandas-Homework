#Conduct Quantitative Analysis
---

##Analyze the data to see if any of the portfolios outperform the stock market (i.e., the S&P 500).
---

###Performance Analysis
---

####Calculate and plot cumulative returns. Does any portfolio outperform the S&P 500?
Yes, Berkshire Hathaway and Algo 1.
---
###Risk Analysis
---

Create a box plot for each of the returns. Which box has the largest spread? Which has the smallest spread?
Berkshire Hathaway has the largest spread. Algo 2 has the smallest.

Calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio. Which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500?
custom_returns, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC.

Calculate the annualized standard deviation (252 trading days).
---
###Rolling Statistics
---

Plot the rolling standard deviation of the various portfolios along with the rolling standard deviation of the S&P 500 using a 21 day rolling window. Does the risk increase for each of the portfolios at the same time risk increases in the S&P?
All of the portfolio's standard deviation increases as the the SP 500 increase.

Construct a correlation table for the algorithmic, whale, and S&P 500 returns. Which returns most closely mimic the S&P?
Algo 2 and Berkshire Hathaway

Choose one portfolio and plot a rolling beta between that portfolio's returns and S&P 500 returns. Does the portfolio seem sensitive to movements in the S&P 500?
Custom return, Paulson and company, and Soros Fund MGMT.

---
###Plot Sharpe Ratios
---

Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.
Only Algo 1 outperforms every other portfolio, Algo 2 is the second lowest in terms of return to risk ratio.

Add your portfolio returns to the DataFrame with the other portfolios and rerun the analysis. How does your portfolio fair?

Algo 1 has the highest return to risk ratio but the second highest is the custom returns portfolio and then the SP 500
